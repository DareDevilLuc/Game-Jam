# Crossroads of Us

**Crossroads of Us** is a 2D top-down psychological romance game built in Godot. Flustered by "love bugs" and the repetitive cycles of relationship dynamics, the game utilizes a looping mechanic to explore the uncertainties of the heart.

## 📖 Game Description

Inspired by the poem *The Road Not Taken*, this game explores the path we *didn't* choose. You play as **Athy**, a character yearning for a happy ending but paralyzed by the uncertainties of love. Navigate through four distinct maps, each with its own unique soundtrack reflecting the stages of love. As she moves through different stages of a relationship, her overthinking begins to manifest as "Love Bugs" in her reality that represent her fears and doubts. When you start to overthink, things feel out of place. You must observe your surroundings carefully. If you notice a love bug, you must decide whether to let it break your heart or leave it all behind.

But heartbreak isn't the end. If you fail, you loop back to the beginning, sometimes meeting old partners or starting anew.
