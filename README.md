# Crossroads of Us

Crossroads of Us is a 2D top-down psychological romance game built in Godot. Flustered by love bugs and the repetitive cycles of relationship dynamics, the game utilizes a looping mechanic to tell its story.

## Game Description

Is love in the air? Experience a romance-focused twist on observation gameplay. You are trapped in a looping hallway of memories and domestic spaces where the environment reflects the state of a relationship.

* **Spot the Changes:** Pay close attention to your surroundings; small shifts indicate the evolving state of human connection.
* **The Loop:** If you notice something is wrong, leave to the left. If everything seems normal, proceed to the right.
* **The Goal:** Break the cycle by navigating the nuances of love as you venture the paths less taken.
